/*Amr and Khaled were just introduced to graph theory.

They decided to play a game together related to graphs. They will pick a random area from google maps. Then, each one has to decide whether they need to represent the roads using directed edges or undirected ones.

Can you help them do the decision?

Input
The first line will contain two integers n, m (2<=n<=100 , 0<=m<= n *(n-1)) where n represents the number of nodes in the graph and m represents the number of edges.

The following m lines will contain two integers a, b (0<=a, b < n , a!=b).

Each of these lines indicate that there is a one-way road from node a to node b.

Note: The graph won't have neither multiple edges https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_edges nor self loops https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(graph_theory).

Output
Print "DIR" if the graph can only be represented using a directed graph.

Otherwise, print "BOTH".

Note: Don't print the double quotes ""! */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
	int n,m;
	cin>>n>>m;
	if((m%2)==0) cout<<"BOTH";
	else cout<<"DIR";
	return 0;
}
