/*Petya studies in a school and he adores Maths. His class has been studying arithmetic expressions. On the last class the teacher wrote three positive integers a, b, c on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations '+' and '*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of the resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example: assume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

1+2*3=7
1*(2+3)=5
1*2*3=6
(1+2)*3=9
Note that you can insert operation signs only between a and b, and between b and c, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample you cannot get expression (1+3)*2.

It's easy to see that the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

Your task is: given a, b and c print the maximum value that you can get.

Input
The input contains three integers a, b and c, each on a single line (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10).

Output
Print the maximum value of the expression that you can obtain.*/

// Example program
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int arr[3];
    for(int i=0; i<3;i++){
        cin>>arr[i];
    }
    int a=arr[0];
    int b=arr[1];
    int c=arr[2];
   
    int x=a+b*c;
    int y=a*b+c;
    int z=a*b*c;
    int e=(a+b)*c;
    int d=a*(b+c);
    int r=a+b+c;

    int max=x;
    if(y>max) max=y;
    if(z>max) max=z;
    if(e>max) max=e;
    if(d>max) max=d;
    if(r>max) max=r;
    cout<<max;
    return 0;
    
}
